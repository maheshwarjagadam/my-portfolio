    <h3>Python Developer – Darwin Technology (Remote, India)</h3>
    <p class="experience-duration">June 2023 – February 2024</p>
    <p>
      As a Python Developer at Darwin Technology, I was responsible for building robust, scalable backend systems using Python and Django. I designed and developed RESTful APIs to support data-driven web applications and implemented complex data processing pipelines using Pandas and NumPy. I played a key role in migrating large datasets to AWS Redshift and automated cloud infrastructure workflows using AWS services such as EC2 and S3. I also contributed to the development of real-time analytics dashboards for clients by integrating Kafka for event streaming. This experience strengthened my ability to manage cloud deployments, work in Agile teams, and contribute clean, production-ready code under tight timelines.

    <h3>Python Developer Intern – Zensar Technologies (Remote, India)</h3>
    <p class="experience-duration">Dec 2022 – May 2023</p>
    <p>
      During my internship at Zensar Technologies, I worked on developing web applications using Python and the Django framework, focusing on server-side logic, database schema design, and API integrations. I was responsible for deploying these applications to cloud platforms like AWS EC2 and configuring PostgreSQL databases hosted on AWS RDS. I also implemented JWT-based authentication for secure endpoints and performed unit testing to ensure high code quality. My involvement in CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins helped me gain practical experience in automated deployments. This role provided hands-on exposure to full-stack Python development and sharpened my understanding of cloud-native application architecture.

    <h3>Python Developer Intern – Darwin Technology (Remote, India)</h3>
    <p class="experience-duration">May 2022 – Nov 2022</p>
    <p>
      At Darwin Technology, I worked extensively with Python to modernize and optimize backend systems and legacy software components. One of my primary responsibilities was rewriting critical Fortran-based modules into Python, significantly improving readability, maintainability, and execution speed. I developed custom Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks, streamline internal workflows, and handle data parsing across I2C/USB interfaces. I also contributed to building interactive dashboards and internal tools using Flask and Jinja2, which were deployed on Apache Tomcat. This experience solidified my backend development skills and deepened my expertise in Python's role in both automation and web technologies.

    <h3>AI/ML Intern – Verzeo x Zebo.AI</h3>
    <p class="experience-duration">July 2021 – Aug 2021</p>
    <p>
      As an AI/ML intern at Verzeo in collaboration with Zebo.AI, I built machine learning models using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib to solve real-world classification and prediction problems. My responsibilities included cleaning and preprocessing raw datasets, selecting the appropriate algorithms, training models, and evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. I also implemented simple visualizations to communicate insights and model outputs effectively. This experience laid the foundation for my continued interest in artificial intelligence and helped me understand how to bridge theoretical knowledge with practical, deployable AI solutions.

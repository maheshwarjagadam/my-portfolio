  <h3>Movie Recommendation System using Sentiment Analysis</h3>
  <p><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong> Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn</p>
  <p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> TF-IDF Vectorization, Naive Bayes Classification</p>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To recommend movies by analyzing user reviews for sentiment.</p>
  <p><strong>Steps Followed:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Collected and cleaned movie review data using Pandas.</li>
    <li>Applied NLTK for sentiment labeling and tokenization.</li>
    <li>Used TF-IDF to convert text into numerical features.</li>
    <li>Trained a Naive Bayes classifier to detect sentiment trends.</li>
    <li>Integrated sentiment scores to recommend positively-rated movies.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Built a sentiment-aware recommendation engine that suggests movies based on emotional tone.</p>

  <h3>KNN vs Scikit-learn Performance Comparison</h3>
  <p><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong> Python, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib</p>
  <p><strong>Algorithms:</strong> K-Nearest Neighbors (custom + Scikit-learn)</p>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To compare a manual implementation of KNN with Scikit-learn’s version for accuracy and speed.</p>
  <p><strong>Steps Followed:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Implemented KNN manually using NumPy distance calculations.</li>
    <li>Loaded datasets and ran both manual and sklearn models on them.</li>
    <li>Measured performance using accuracy scores and runtime benchmarks.</li>
    <li>Visualized decision boundaries using Matplotlib.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Learned trade-offs between custom algorithms and optimized library solutions.</p>

  <h3>Hotel Management System (In Progress)</h3>
  <span class="project-status ongoing">In Progress</span>
  <p><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python (Flask), SQLite</p>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To develop a full-stack web application that simplifies hotel property management, including bookings, room availability, customer records, and admin operations.</p>
  <p><strong>Thought Process:</strong> Inspired by the need for affordable and modern hotel software for small businesses, this system focuses on simplicity and real-time control. The design includes login-based admin access, calendar-based booking flow, and mobile responsiveness.</p>
  <p><strong>Process:</strong> Currently outlining database schema and planning user flow. Next step is developing a clean dashboard UI and integrating SQLite-based backend for persistent storage.</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Design & Backend Planning Phase</p>

  <h3>Dharma-Based AI Chatbot with Voice Support (In Progress)</h3>
  <span class="project-status ongoing">In Progress</span>
  <p><strong>Languages & Tools:</strong> Python, Flask, OpenAI API (planned), JavaScript (Web Speech API)</p>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> To create a chatbot that provides ethical and spiritual guidance based on Hindu scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana, answering user questions through both text and voice interfaces.</p>
  <p><strong>Thought Process:</strong> The idea is to merge ancient wisdom with modern AI by interpreting dharma-centered advice through a GPT-powered system. The goal is to create not just a technical tool, but a **moral companion** that reflects Indian philosophy in modern decision-making.</p>
  <p><strong>Process:</strong> Currently gathering reference verses and building a guidance framework based on principles of karma, duty, and balance. Voice-to-text functionality and chatbot integration will be added after base logic is finalized.</p>
  <p><strong>Status:</strong> Concept Design Completed, Development Pending</p>
